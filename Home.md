# Lab 9: Take Control - The PID Feedback Controller

## Project Summary:

For this lab we are planning to combine the previous lab with the Arduino robocar and pair it with a control system that allows the car to keep a certain distance away from an object or wall that may get in the carâ€™s pathway. The goal is to add a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller on the Arduino robocar. A PID is commonly use by engineers. It calculates the error between the setpoint (SP) and the measured value. The error is then fed into the amplifier, integrator, and differentiator which are summed and create a parameter that changes the effect of the overall process. In addition to a PID, we will use the ultrasonic distance as a sensor to detect objects and keep the car away.
