## Project Summary:

For this lab we are planning to combine the previous lab with the Arduino robocar and pair it with a control system that allows the car to keep a certain distance away from an object or wall that may get in the carâ€™s pathway. The goal is to add a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller on the Arduino robocar. A PID is commonly use by engineers. It calculates the error between the setpoint (SP) and the measured value. The error is then fed into the amplifier, integrator, and differentiator which are summed and create a parameter that changes the effect of the overall process. In addition to a PID, we will use the ultrasonic distance as a sensor to detect objects and keep the car away.  

## Design/Methods:

For this lab we need:
* A computer running Arduino IDE: MacBook Air
* RedBoard, ultrasonic sensor, two motors, motor driver, and a battery pack: SparkFun Inventor's Kit

**Part One: PID Use**

We used the robocar that we assembled in Lab 8 using the RedBoard, ultrasonic sensor, two motors, motor driver, and the wheels from the SparkFun Inventor's Kit.

We first installed the PID_v2 library onto Arduino IDE running on the computer and opened the code that we used in Lab 8 to run the robocar by entering a direction and speed when prompted. We then needed to edit the code to include PID control. The complete code is labeled as lab9part1.ino in the files of this repository. 

We began by including the PID_v2 library. 
```c++
#include <PID_v2.h>
```
We then, defined the setpoint, measurement, output, Kp, Ki, and Kd variables. We also created the PID instance. This code is all before the setup function in the code to run the robocar.
```c++
double MEAS = 0;
double OUT = 0;
double setpoint = 0;
double Kp = 0;
double Ki = 0;
double Kd = 0;
PID myPID(&MEAS, &OUT, &setpoint, Kp, Ki, Kd, DIRECT);
```
Within the setup function, we initialized the PID.
```c++
myPID.SetTunings(Kp, Ki, Kd);
myPID.SetMode(AUTOMATIC);
```
In the loop function, we ran the PID after the Arduino obtains the distance from the ultrasonic sensor. 
```c++
myPID.Compute();// new
```
We then printed the setpoint, measurement, and output to the serial port so that we could see that the PID was working.
```c++
 Serial.print(setpoint);
 Serial.print(",");
 Serial.print(MEAS);
 Serial.print(",");
 Serial.println(OUT);
```
We then tested to see if the code worked and if the variables sent to the serial port were correct.
